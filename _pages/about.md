About
===
I am currently a Ph.D. Student at Johns Hopkins University, Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics. My advisor is James C. Spall. My current research interests include:
 - Stochastic Optimization
 - Statistical Learning
 - Automated Machine Learning
 
On the theoretical side, my research focuses on designing stochastic optimization algorithms (gradient-based or gradient-free) and analyzing the efficiency of these algorithms. On the applied side, I seek to apply stochastic optimization methods in statisical learning related problems.
